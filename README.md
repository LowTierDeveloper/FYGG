# FYGG (F*** You GoGuardian)

## Info
Hello! Welcome to the repo for FYGG. Thanks for visiting!

FYGG is a launcher for a proxy that allows you to do things such as browse the web freely and privately, play games, and use apps such as Discord or Twitter.

With the method I used in this repo, you can open the proxy and is unable to be seen by GoGuardian.

Although the proxy itself is invisible to GoGuardian, the launcher is not. Beware of opening the launcher when GoGuardian is in use.

## Local Installation

To install FYGG locally, click the green ``Code`` button in the top right, and click ``Download ZIP``. After that, open the ZIP and open the ``index.html`` file.
